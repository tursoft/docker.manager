This container is used to browse public ports of running containers under given servers. \
NOTE: To be able to access docker api, you should expose docker remote api. You have different options for that. \
\
Method 1: Remote Api Proxy Container: \
There are plentty of such containers. I can suggest following one => jarkt/docker-remote-api (https://hub.docker.com/r/jarkt/docker-remote-api/) \
\
Method 2: Enable Remote Api on Docker Engine: \
It is also possible to enable docker remote api by some config changes. NOTE: this process requires a docker service restart. \
You can follow following steps: https://www.ivankrizsan.se/2016/05/18/enabling-docker-remote-api-on-ubuntu-16-04/ \
